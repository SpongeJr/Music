Javascript for Song Sheets

Use this jQuery plugin to transpose chords in a song in your HTML pages.

- Transpose.js contains the plugin.
- PollyWollyDoodle.html contains an example of using it.
- WayfaringStranger.html contains a minor key example.
- package.json for plugins.jQuery.com

Note that this does not try to figure out a song's tonality.
You must supply a key (see example HTML) for correct transposition of some enharmonics.

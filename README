Javascript for Song Sheets

Use this jQuery plugin to transpose chords in a song in your HTML pages.

- Transpose.js contains the plugin.
- PollyWollyDoodle.html contains an example of using it.
- package.json for plugins.jQuery.com

BUG: It doesn't handle chord inversions like "D/A" gracefully.
A workaround is to use <span class="chord">D</span>/<span class="chord">A</span>
instead of <span class="chord">D/A</span>.
